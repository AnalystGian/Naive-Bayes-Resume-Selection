# Naive-Bayes-Resume-Selection

In this project, we will build a Naïve Bayes classifiers to predict whether a given resume text is flagged or not. Our training data consist of 125 resumes with 33 flagged resumes and 92 non-flagged resumes. This project could be practically used to screen resumes in companies.

# Learning Objectives
1. Apply python libraries to import and visualize dataset
2. Perform exploratory data analysis and plot word-cloud
3. Perform text data cleaning such as removing punctuation and stop words
4. Understand the concept of count vectorization (tokenization)
5. Perform tokenization using count vectorizer
6. Understand the theory and intuition behind Naïve Bayes classifiers
7. Train Naïve Bayes classifier models using Scikit-Learn to perform classification
8. Evaluate the performance of trained Naïve Bayes Classifier model using confusion matrices.
